## Quick Start Checklist

In order to use BTC EmbeddedPlatform steps in your Jenkins Pipeline, here's what should be prepared upfront:

<details>
  <summary>Jenkins Controller</summary>
  Have the btc-embeddedplatform-plugin (BTC DSL for Pipeline) installed on the Jenkins Controller
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Jenkins Agent</summary>
  A Jenkins Agent with:

  - Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 LTSC
  - BTC EmbeddedPlatformJenkinsAutomation Plugin for BTC EmbeddedPlatform (installed manually or via the BTC Plugin Manager)
  - In order to prevent problems with user access rights it is important to let the Jenkins agent process run as a specific user. In case your connection to the Controller uses a Windows Service, you need to make it log on as a specific user instead of "Local System Accout":
![jenkins-service-user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5657657/109487642-c687ea80-7a84-11eb-9c85-c12f0c275cc6.png)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Licensing</summary>
  You'll need a multi-site network license for "EmbeddedTester" and "Test Automation Server"
  
  - The license server can be configured via the "licenseLocationString" parameter in the profileLoad / profileCreateXX step
  - it can also be configured directly on the Jenkins Agent via the BTC EmbeddedPlatform GUI on the Jenkins Agent

  In case Jenkins initially fails to connect to BTC EmbeddedPlatform ("400: Timeout while connecting to BTC EmbeddedPlatform") you may have forgotten to install the "Jenkins Automation Plugin for BTC EmbeddedPlatform" (see above: Jenkins Agent). If you did install the plugin, you might want to go to %APPDATA%/BTC/ep and delete the directory matching the EP version you're using. This is normally done during the plugin installation sometimes there are issues with non-admin users or other applications interfering.
</details>

## Description

The Jenkins Automation Plugin for BTC EmbeddedPlatform provides easy to
use steps for Jenkins Pipeline enabling you to execute test workflow
steps from Jenkins. The BTC EmbeddedPlatform HTML reports become
available automatically on the Jenkins job page and a JUnit XML report
is generated that feeds into Jenkins test trends and status overview
dashboards.

The following workflow steps are available for Jenkins Pipeline:

-   Profile Load / Create / Update
-   Import of Test Cases and Stimuli Vectors
-   Import / Export of Tolerances and Input Restrictions
-   Execution of Functional Tests
-   Automatic Vector Generation & Analysis
-   Back-to-Back Test Execution
-   Regression Test Execution
-   Formal Verification
-   Formal Test
-   Configuration of Additional Coverage Goals
-   Export of different reports
-   BTC Migration Suite

For these workflow steps many additional settings can be configured
(optional) in order to adapt the automated test runs to your individual
project needs. In addition, two utility methods help you to connect to
instances of BTC EmbeddedPlatform and to close them if again required.
In addition, the Migration Suite use case can be addressed (see section
Migration Suite below).

Not settings a scope path will still default to the toplevel scope.<br>- Added the parameter "useCase" for the Code Analysis Report Step (RBT / B2B)<br>- Removed obsolete parameter "inputRestrictions" from the Vector Generation step. Input Restrictions can be defined through their own step.<br>- Users can now select the use case for the codeAnalysisReport step (RBT / B2B)<br>- The codeAnalysisReport now exports a csv file ("BTCCoverageOverview_B2B.csv" / "BTCCoverageOverview_RBT.csv") to the report directory which contains overall coverage percentage (Statement, Decision and MCDC). This CSV file can be used by other Jenkins plugins to display the coverage. | 2.3 |  | 
2.0.7 | - Fixed missing parameters (reuseExistingCode, pilConfig, pilTimeout)<br>- Added parameters for environmentXmlPath (TL Profile Creation), testMode (grey box / black box) and startupScriptPath | 2.3 |  | 
2.0.3 | - Adapted to EP 2.3<br>- A Failed Profile Creation / Profile load will now always throw an exception to break the build<br>- In case of failures during profile creation profile messages will be exported and made available in Jenkins (if possible)<br>- Fixed a bug that prevented the use of some settings for the wrapUp step.<br>- Fixed a bug that caused a specified PLL to be ignored.<br>- Jenkins: HPI plugin ("btc-embeddedplatform-plugin") is now available in the official Jenkins plugin repository | 2.3 |  | 
2.0.1 | - The Vector Generation step now supports dummy toplevels. If the toplevel subsystem is a dummy scope (no C-function available) then the vector generation will be done on the direct children of the toplevel.<br>- Domain Coverage and Range Violation goals can now be added to the profile and considered during vector generation (requires additional plugins)<br>- Fixed a bug that caused execution records to not be available for debugging in the migration suite use case.<br>- archiveArtifacts and stash commands used by the btc-embeddedplatform plugin are now only called if needed and were changed to be more specific<br>- Fixed an issue that could cause existing profiles to be loaded in the migration suite scenario. From now on the migrationSuite will always create a new profile.<br>- Profile Creation can now be invoked explicitly.<br>- The Code Analysis Report can now be created explicitly. It was formerly created by the Vector Generation step. That's still possible but not enabled by default (controlled by property "createReport" in the btc.vectorGeneration step). | 2.2p2 |  | 

## Prerequisites

This plugin only works in combination with BTC EmbeddedPlatform which
needs to be installed and licensed separately.

## Jenkins Pipeline

### Overview

Integrating test runs with BTC EmbeddedPlatform in your Jenkins
workflows combines the automation and traceability concepts and results
in great benefits:

1.  The automated workflows scale for multiple components / projects
    with low configuration effort
2.  You are easily able to trace changes made to your system under test
    from the Source Code Management to the integrated product and
    recognize test failures early in the process
3.  The pipeline visualization intuitively shows how much time each
    phase of the testing process takes  
    ![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/173703174/StageView_Tracability.png?version=1&modificationDate=1558695687000&api=v2)
4.  The Jenkins Automation Plugin produces an XML report in the JUnit
    format that can be analyzed by Jenkins to provide test status trends
    over multiple executions and projects  
    ![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/173703174/JUnit-Test-Result-Trend.png?version=1&modificationDate=1558695680000&api=v2)
5.  Comprehensive HTML Reports from BTC EmbeddedPlatform are available
    directly from the Jenkins job page  
      

    Jenkins' Content Security Policy can prevent the reports from being
    displayed properly. See [Configuring Content Security
    Policy](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy)
    for further details.

6.  Relevant artifacts like the test profile are accessible for easy
    debugging and analysis

    ![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/thumbnails/173703174/save-profile.png?version=1&modificationDate=1558695685000&api=v2)

### Licensing for Jenkins Integration

In addition to the basic license requirements that depend on the chosen
workflow steps which require EmbeddedTester or EmbeddedValidator the
Jenkins Automation use case requires the "Test Automation Server"
floating network license (ET\_AUTOMATION\_SERVER).

Since v2.4.0 it's possible to run ET\_BASE use cases (Architecture
Import, Test Case Import, Test Execution, Reporting) with an
EmbeddedTester BASE installation and the license
ET\_AUTOMATION\_SERVER\_BASE.

### Configuration

In a Jenkins Pipeline the configuration of a job can be defined as
simple groovy code which can be versioned alongside the main source
files of the component. A full documentation of the Jenkins Pipeline can
be found **[here](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)**. The
following example shows of how BTC EmbeddedPlatform can be automated
from Jenkins via the BTC DSL for Pipeline Plugin. The Plugin needs to be
installed in Jenkins and dedicated BTC methods to create a test
automation workflow.

**Pipeline Example**

``` groovy
pipeline {
    agent none // agent can be defined per stage
    stages {
        stage ('BTC Unit Test') {
            // Stage must run on an agent with the required software, e.g.:
            // - Matlab Simulink + Code Generator
            // - Compiler (Visual Studio / MinGW)
            // - BTC EmbeddedPlatform incl. JenkinsAutomation plugin
            agent { label 'my_btc_agent' }

            steps {
                // checkout files from repository referenced in this pipeline item
                checkout scm
                // Tests with BTC EmbeddedPlatform
                script {
                    // start BTC EmbeddedPlatform on Agent
                    btc.startup {
                        additionalJvmArgs = '-Xmx2g'
                    }
                    
                    // load and update test project
                    btc.profileLoad {
                        profilePath = "my_module.epp"
                        tlModelPath = "my_module.slx"
                        tlScriptPath = "start.m"
                        matlabVersion = "2020b"
                        updateRequired = true
                    }

                    // Execute requirements-based tests
                    btc.rbtExecution {
                        createReport = true
                    }

                    // Generate vectors for statement & mcdc coverage
                    btc.vectorGeneration {
                        pll = "STM; MCDC"
                    }
                    
                    // Generate coverage reports
                    btc.codeAnalysisReport { useCase = "RBT" }
                    btc.codeAnalysisReport { useCase = "B2B" }
                    
                    // B2B test model vs. code
                    btc.backToBack {
                        reference = "TL MIL"
                        comparison = "SIL"
                    }
                
                    // BTC: close EmbeddedPlatform and store reports
                    btc.wrapUp {}
                }
            }
            post {
                always {
                    // make sure that EP is closed, also in case of errors or if the build is aborted
                    script { btc.killEp {} }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}   

```

## Workflow Steps

### Basics

#### Step "startup"

DSL Command: btc.startup {...}

**Description**

Method to connect to BTC EmbeddedPlatform with a specified port. If BTC
EmbeddedPlatform is not available it is started and the method waits
until it is available. The following optional settings are available:

Property | Description | Example Value(s)
---------|-------------|-----------------
port | Port used to connect to EmbeddedPlatform.<br>(default: 29267) | 1234, 29268, 8073
matlabPort | RMI port used to connect EmbeddedPlatform to Matlab.<br>(default: 29300 + (port % 100)) | 1090, 29300, 1234
timeout | Timeout in seconds before the attempt to connect to EmbeddedPlatform is cancelled. This timeout should consider the worst case CPU & IO performance which influences the tool startup.<br>(default: 120) | 40, 60, 120
licensingPackage | Name of the licensing package to use, e.g. to use a EmbeddedTester BASE.<br>(default: ET_COMPLETE) | ET_BASE
installPath | Path to the BTC EmbeddedPlatform installation directory<br>Usually this can be omitted, the "active" EP version will be chosen (queried from the windows registry) | "C:/Program Files/BTC/ep2.8p0"
additionalJvmArgs | String with space separated arguments to be passed to the JVM<br>(expert property - only use if you know what you're doing!) | "-Xmx2g"

**Possible Return values**

Return Value | Description
-----------------|----------------
200 | Started a new instance of BTC EmbeddedPlatform and successfully connected to it.
201 | Successfully connected to an already running instance of BTC EmbeddedPlatform.
400 | Timeout while connecting to BTC EmbeddedPlatform (either manually specified or 120 seconds).
500 | Unexpected Error

_Jenkins will always connect to the active version of EmbeddedPlatform
since many tasks will only work with the version that is integrated into
Matlab. Please ensure that the correct EP version is active by
choosing Activate BTC EmbeddedPlatform in your start menu for the
desired version and also ensure that the Jenkins Automation Plugin is
installed for this version of EmbeddedPlatform._

#### Step "profileLoad"

DSL Command: btc.profileLoad {...}

**Description**

Opens the profile if the specified profile exists, otherwise creates a
new profile. A profile update is only performed if this is required.
Profile Creation requires either a TargetLink model or C-Code in
combination with a CodeModel.xml architecture description.

_The "profileLoad" step or any of the "profileCreate" steps are a
mandatory starting point for all automation workflows._

Property | Description | Example Value(s)

tlModelPath | Path of the TargetLink model. The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. | "model.slx"
tlScriptPath | Path of the model init script. The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. | "init.m"
tlSubsystem | Name of the Subsystem representing the TL top-level subsystem for the analysis. Note: Argument is mandatory if there is more than one top-level system in the model. | "Controller"
environmentXmlPath | Path to the XML file with additional include paths, etc.. The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. (only relevant for TargetLink use cases) | "Environment.xml"
startupScriptPath | Path to a Startup Script which can be used to initialize matlab (e.g. toolchain startup, etc.). The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. | "startup_toolchain.m"
codeModelPath | Path of the hand code description file. The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. | "CodeModel.xml"
compilerShortName | Short name of the compiler that should be used (C-Code Use Case). Fallback will be an already selected compiler or, if undefined, the first one that is found. | "MSSDK71", "MSVC140", "MinGW64"
slModelPath | Path of the Simulink model. The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. | "slModel.slx"
slScriptPath | Path of the model init script for the Simulink model. The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. | "init.m"
addModelInfoPath | Path to the XML file with additional model info for SL use case. The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. | "AddGenModelInfo.xml"

#### Step "backToBack"

DSL Command: btc.backToBack {...}

**Required License**

EmbeddedTester (ET\_COMPLETE)

**Description**

Executes a Back-to-Back Test between the specified reference and
comparison configuration (e.g. TL MIL vs. SIL). This step requires
stimuli vectors or functional test cases in the profile. A Back-to-Back
Test Report will be exported to the "exportDir" specified in the
"profileLoad" step.

In automated scenarios the effort for manual reviews of frequently
executed Back-to-Back tests can become quite high. The BTC plugin
"ApplyFailedAccepted" deals with this challenge by applying your
manually accepted deviations to all future Back-to-Back Tests as long as
the deviating values are equal. For more information, please contact
<support@btc-es.de>.

  

The following optional settings are available:

Property | Description | Example Value(s)
---------|-------------|-----------------
reference | Execution config for the Back-to-Back test reference simulation.<br>(default: "TL MIL") | TL MIL, SIL, PIL, SL MIL
comparison | Execution config for the Back-to-Back test comparison simulation.<br>(default: "SIL") | TL MIL, SIL, PIL, SL MIL

#### Step "formalVerification"

DSL Command: btc.formalVerification {...}

**Required License**

EmbeddedValidator (EV)

**Description**

Executes all existing proofs in the profile and generates a Formal
Verification Report. The following optional settings are available:

Property | Description | Example Value(s)
---------|-------------|-----------------
loopUnroll | If the code that is to be analyzed contains loops without explicit maximum number of iterations, e.g. a while(true) loop, these loops need to be unrolled. The given number provides the number of iterations for these loops that is used for the analysis. This unrolling is done in such a way that a "fulfilled" or "fulfilled (n steps)" result can only be obtained if this limit is not exceeded by any possible execution. Conversely, a trace that violates this limit can be found as a witness trace despite not strictly violating the formal requirement itself. This is indicated in the termination reason as "Loop unroll limit (n) exceeded".<br>(default: 32) | 10, 30, 50
memoryLimit | Memory Limit (MB)<br>The maximum memory footprint to be used by the analysis tools of the EmbeddedPlatform. If an analysis cannot be completed within these limits, this may lead to termination reason "Memory limit (n MB) exceeded"<br>(default: unlimited)
 | 0 (= unlimited), 1024, 3456
timeLimit | Time Limit (Seconds)<br>The maximum duration the proof execution may take (excluding some of the pre- and postprocessing tasks, which in general are less time intensive than the actual model checking). This limit should be used especially whenever the proof execution is left unattended and multiple proofs are to be executed in batch. Otherwise, a single proof execution may consume most of the run time and no results would be obtained for the other proofs.<br>(default: unlimited) | 0 (= unlimited), 60, 1000
searchDepth | Search depth (Steps)<br>the number of executions of the scope under test (i.e. how many execution steps may a counter example be long). This limit corresponds to the term "unwinding depth" employed in bounded model checking. Again, if no such limit is provided, the search for a counter example may in the worst case spend large amounts of time looking for longer and longer counter examples.<br>(default: unlimited) | 0 (= unlimited), 10, 50

**Possible Return values**

| Return Value     | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 200              | All proofs are fulfilled (status: FULFILLED)   |
| 300              | There was a violation (status: VIOLATED)       |
| 301              | Unknown (status: UNKNOWN)                      |
| 400              | BTC EmbeddedValidator package is not installed |
| 500              | Unexpected Error                               |

#### "overallReport"

DSL Command: btc.finalWrapUp{...}

**Description**

Property | Description | Example Value(s)
---------|-------------|-----------------
path* | Relative or absolute path of a workspace directory to temporarily store the reporting data<br>**MANDATORY** | "reports"

Creates an Overall Report to provide an overview over multiple test projects. In cases where you have a set of models and are running tests in multiple test projects, this report will summarize the overall status and provide links to the *.epp files and the individual reports. Requires all projects to have been tested on the same agent (for inter-report linking).

This is a somewhat special step that requires some preparation:
- btc.collectProjectOverview{} needs to be called for each project *before* the wrapUp method is called. This stores the projects overview data.
- btc.wrapUp needs to be called for each project in order to generate the individual project reports (Test Automation report + detailed reports)
- btc.finalWrapUp{} will take the data collected previously to create the overview report. Since the report generation works based on the BTC EmbeddedPlatform report template engine, this requires an instance of BTC EmbeddedPlatform to be available. The finalWrapUp step will then close BTC EmbeddedPlatform.

<details>
  <summary>Example of a pipeline with an overview report</summary>

  ``` groovy
  node {
      // checkout changes from SCM
      checkout scm

      // one profile for each *.slx file

#### Step "getStatusSummary"

DSL Command: btc.getStatusSummary()

**Required License**

EmbeddedTester (ET COMPLETE)

**Description**

Retrieves a struct as a json text (see below) which can be passed on to external post-processing or evalulated directly (via readJSON of the Pipeline Utility Steps plugin):

- ProfileName
- Coverage
  - RBT
    - RequirementsCoverage
    - StatementCoverage
    - ConditionCoverage
    - DecisionCoverage
    - ModifiedConditionDecisionCoverage
    - RelationalOperatorCoverage
    - FunctionCoverage
    - FunctionCallCoverage
    - SwitchCaseCoverage
    - UserDefinedCoverageGoalsCoverage
    - DomainCoverageGoalsCoverage
    - RangeViolationGoalsCoverage
    - DivisionByZeroRobustnessCheck
    - DowncastRobustnessCheck

    - UserDefinedCoverageGoalsCoverage
    - DomainCoverageGoalsCoverage
    - RangeViolationGoalsCoverage
    - DivisionByZeroRobustnessCheck
    - DowncastRobustnessCheck
  - TestCases (list of objects with the following properties)
    - Name
    - Description
    - Result
    - VerifiedRequirements (list of strings)
    - Length
    - CreatedOn

#### Error Handling
It is important that the EP process is closed to free the used resources and that the reserved port on the agent is released.
To ensure this in an easy manner, the DSL command btc.handleError(errorMsg) is provided. It will safely close EP, release the used port and then call the Jenkins error(...) command with the given error message.

## BTC Migration Suite

The BTC Migration Suite allows you to perform a fully automatic
regression test between different Matlab or TargetLink versions. This
makes it easy to document that the change of a tool version in a
particular project does not influence the behavior of software
components on model and code level.

**Required License**

EmbeddedTester (ET\_COMPLETE)

#### Step "migrationSource"

DSL Command: btc.migrationSource {...}

**Description**

Creates a profile on the source configuration (e.g. old Matlab /
TargetLink version), generates vectors for full coverage and exports the
simulation results.

#### Step "migrationTarget"

DSL Command: btc.migrationTarget {...}

**Description**

Creates a profile on the target configuration (e.g. newMatlab /
TargetLink version), imports the simulation results from the source
config and runs a regression test.

  

For both steps (migrationSource and migrationTarget) the following
parameters are mandatory:

Property | Description | Example Value(s)
---------|-------------|-----------------
**tlModelPath** | Path of the TargetLink model. The path can be absolute or relative to the jenkins job's workspace.< | "tlModel.slx", "model.mdl"
matlabVersion | Controls which matlab version will be used by the tool.<br>String containing the release version (e.g. "2016b"), optionally followed by "32-bit" or "64-bit". The version and 32/64-bit part should be separated by a space character. | "2010a 32-bit"<br>"2016b"

In Addition, you can add all other the parameters from the
steps btc.profileLoad and btc.vectorGeneration if required.

### Migration Suite Example: Jenkinsfile

The following example shows a Jenkinsfile for a complete migration of a
TargetLink model. The labels that are specified for the node describe
the resource requirements for each configuration and allow Jenkins to
provide a suitable agent. Any data produced by the migrationSource step
which is needed by the migrationTarget step will be automatically
handled by Jenkins. This way, the agent for the target config (which is
obviously a different one machine due to the different Windows versions)
will have access to the simulation results from the source config
required for the regression test.

**Migration Suite Example**

``` groovy
node ('Win7 && TL41 && ML2015b') {

    checkout scm
 
    stage ("Migration Source") {
        btc.migrationSource {
            matlabVersion = "2015b"
            tlModelPath = "source/model.mdl"
            tlScriptPath = "start.m"
        }
    }
}

node ('Win10 && TL43 && ML2017b') {

    checkout scm
 
    stage ("Migration Target") {
        btc.migrationTarget {
            matlabVersion = "2017b"
            tlModelPath = "target/model.mdl"
            tlScriptPath = "start.m"
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding the BTC Plugin to Jenkins

In order to use the convenient pipeline syntax described above you need
to add the BTC Plugin to Jenkins. This is very easy and can be done with
the following steps:

On your Jenkins web UI go to Jenkins \> Manage Jenkins \> Manage Plugins

Click on the Available tab and search for btc-embeddedplatform

Select the plugin btc-embeddedplatform and install it

1.  Once the plugin is installed new versions which are available will
    appear in the Updates section
2.  Updating a plugin usually requires you to restart your Jenkins
    master

The BTC Pipeline plugin is now available in Jenkins and you can benefit
from the convenient BTC pipeline methods described in the sections
above. Enjoy!

If your Jenkins master can't access the internet you can manually
download the plugin
[here](https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/latest/btc-embeddedplatform.hpi)
and upload it to the server via the advanced section of the "Manage
Plugins" page.
